# Fireplace Slider Data Analysis - Jewel-Pretty vs Fire-Danger

## What it does

After redesigning the experiment with better prompts, we reconstructed a few graphs.

Histograms of the slope of the relationship between "pretty/danger" and "like fire" using each chunk as a data point. Each data point in the histogram is a single participant's slope.

This creates a scatter plot of dangerous vs pretty and creates a linear regression to measure the relationship.

It also creates heatmaps measuring the average scores for each chunk.
