# FireplaceSlider Data Analysis - Flicker Measurement

Only run the c-make_data_scatter_plots.py script, the other c- scripts export a function used by the scatter plot script.

Not too sure what I was doing in d-random_experiment.py, but it's not used, keeping it for now.

## What it does

For various methods of calculating flickerness (one in each c- script), we create a scatter plot of the flickerness vs the pretty and dangerous rating.
