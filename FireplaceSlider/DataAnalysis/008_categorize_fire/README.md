# Fireplace Slider Data Analysis - Categorize Fire

## What it does

Firstly, we create a scatterplot of the pretty vs dangerous ratings, then we added an abitrary line to separate the data into "high danger-pretty" and "low danger-pretty". Then we looked and where the chunks were in the fire, and assigned a category to each chunk based on where it was (in the fire or not in the fire).

Then we colored each chunk based on its category, and saved the image. It also can be used to generate a video of the fire with the overlay.
