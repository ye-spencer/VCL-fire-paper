# Fireplace Slider Data Analysis Flicker Measurement

## What it does

After selecting the best flicker measurement method (see 009_flicker_measurement), we use that method to calculate the flicker for each chunk. Then we create a scatter plot of the flicker vs the pretty and dangerous rating. This time we add the average color of the chunk to the plot.

Additionally, we create color bars to show the average color of the chunks as sorted by the flicker measurement.
