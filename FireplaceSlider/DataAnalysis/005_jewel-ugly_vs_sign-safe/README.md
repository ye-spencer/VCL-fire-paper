# Fireplace Slider Data Analysis - Jewel-Ugly vs Sign-Safe

## What it does

After redesigning the experiment with better prompts, we reconstructed a few graphs. This time we are using ugly and safe as our two independent variables.

Histograms of the slope of the relationship between "ugly/safe" and "like fire" using each chunk as a data point. Each data point in the histogram is a single participant's slope.

This creates a scatter plot of "ugly" vs "safe" and creates a linear regression to measure the relationship.

It also creates heatmaps measuring the average scores for each chunk.
