# Little Fire Experiments Photo Right

## Overview

In this experiment, we will be showing participants four images and ask them which looks the most right. They will be arranged in a 2 x 2 grid.

## General Specifications

Running the Experiment with 100 People

For each image, we should randomize the location, within the grind, and we should track which location is in which (that is, give each a name) in our experiment data, and also how long it took them to click a response and submit

There should be like a minute wait to ensure the participants read everything (not necessarily a minute, but something that feels natural and forces people to read and wait)

The first screen should be a text with like the prompt, then have a plus that outlines the grid before the images populate

The Prompt is as follows: you will see four pictures, each picture includes a person, a dog and a fireplace. your job is to click on which picture has the most natural or typical or expected relationship between the dog the person and the fireplace
